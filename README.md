# Project Overview

Parcel Delivery API is a secure, role-based backend system built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB, designed to manage a parcel delivery workflow similar to popular logistics platforms.

This system allows different user roles — Admin, Sender, and Receiver — to interact with parcels based on permissions. Key features include parcel creation, tracking, status updates, delivery confirmation, blocking/unblocking, and advanced filtering with search capabilities.

The backend ensures robust data validation, modular architecture, and scalable design principles following RESTful conventions.
