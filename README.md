# Project Overview

Parcel Delivery API is a secure, role-based backend system built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB, designed to manage a parcel delivery workflow similar to popular logistics platforms.

This system allows different user roles ‚Äî Admin, Sender, and Receiver ‚Äî to interact with parcels based on permissions. Key features include parcel creation, tracking, status updates, delivery confirmation, blocking/unblocking, and advanced filtering with search capabilities.

The backend ensures robust data validation, modular architecture, and scalable design principles following RESTful conventions.
